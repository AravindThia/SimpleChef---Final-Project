hello mate

Android Studio 
==============

Version 4.1.2 

Introduction
------------

Hello everyone! Im Aravind and this is my Cooking recipe app.

This is just the first version of the app with minimal recipes, IT JUST THE BEGINNING

I will continue to upgrade the app and continue adding recipes!!!

Cooking is one of the things I am most passionate about. I love to cook when I am stressed or when I am bored. I've experimented on a lot of recipes and worked on how I can make something super delicious but also very simple. 


I made a lot of recipes that are super simple so anyone can make them. I was looking for a way to put these recipes up for people to see, use and try for themselves. Now I have the opportunity to make an app where I can store all my recipes not only for me but for everyone else to use. 


Simplechef is an app that will have all my recipes with proper step-by-step instructions on how to cook the food. I want this app to be free and help people cook delicious food with cheap and simple ingredients. 


My main Goal for this Project
-----------------------------

The main goal of this project is to create an app with simple recipes for people to cook. I want the app to be very clear, easy to use (no complication), I don't only want to have step by step, I want pictures, videos, and the steps on the page for the recipes.  
I want my app to actually help people cook delicious food. I want to get people to cook for themselves and hopefully, they will learn to enjoy cooking.
